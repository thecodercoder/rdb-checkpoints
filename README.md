# rdb-checkpoints

Code checkpoints for each section in the Responsive Design for Beginners course.

Each subfolder contains the **starter** files for that section. For example, the `01_Basic_Course/06 - Hero` folder has the codebase in the state it should be at the **beginning** of the Hero section (before the Hero has been built).

At the end of each course I have also included a subfolder that has the files in the state they should be when the course is complete. For example, the `01_Basic_Course/End of Basic Course` folder has the state the code files should be in when the Basic Course is completed.
